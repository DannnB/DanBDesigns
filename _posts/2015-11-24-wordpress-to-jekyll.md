### Choosing Jekyll Over WordPress

I use Wordpress all the time and its brilliant for what it offers and what its capable of. Over the last couple of years with my personal site I have gone though at least 5+ re-installations and many more redesigns. Must of these were unnecessary but the designer in me wanted to keep changing stuff over and over again.

This is why I chose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"){:target="_blank"}.

Before, I could not do anything with Front End tools but now I have got much further where I can move on to the next level. Plus [Pixyll](http://www.pixyll.com "Pixyll's Website"){:target="_blank"} theme is beautiful.

Over 8 hours, I have this site with content up and running. It took a while for me to get to grips with different things like getting it to build without errors! I do find that a lot of these frameworks don't help the newbies. *I still have yet to get the new [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html "Foudnation 6 Website"){:target="_blank"} to build.* Will assign a free day to get that working!

I'm enjoying using Jekyll so far and using Markdown makes a huge change from HTML and the WordPress visual editor. [Markdown Pad 2](http://markdownpad.com/ "Markdown Pad 2 Website"){:target="_blank"} is worth the money for Pro.

Using frontend build tools is useful and i'm looking forward to looking into more of it. Gulp, Bower and others.

Thanks for reading this far,
