##Week 1 Updates!

After setting myself this challenge I had a look through all the content, quizzes and projects. Then I realised that Pro holds a lot more than I thought.

The JavaScript Final Project takes around 10 hours to complete. 

What I have forgotten to mention before was that anyone can rush though these courses copy & pasting. I plan to really drill it in my head and make sure I understand as much as I humanly can by the end of it. 

Even if it's asking me to output `"Hello, my name is Dan"` with `console.log` I try to add the stuff I learned before. Such as, adding something as simple as a  `prompt` so any name can be outputted (Simplified Example). 

##So JavaScript!

I was looking forward to getting a go at this course. I have messed around with jQuery a lot before and taught myself a lot of concepts. Which would help me with the understanding behind pure JavaScript.

*Justin Bieber! I had some fun with the user responses on that section.*

####Unit Overview

My personal bottle neck was when I got to objects . Previously I knew the concepts/uses behind loops but objects was mostly new to me. That section I will have to revise a couple more times after this challenge.

The progression from each unit is very well thought out. You get a review of the section at the end In the next unit you sometimes get to use the previous code you've learned with the new code you're learning.


#####Quizzes 
I plan to go back to them every so often to keep it in my mind what I learn. 

One thing that bothers me is they have 1 set of questions that rearrange each time you use it. What might be nice to do is have a couple of different sets for people who like the challenge of a quiz. 

Having 3 different levels for each quiz on every unit would be awesome! 

I appreciate that code Pro is pretty new but it would be a nice feature to make an even better investment for Pro.


##Week 2

#####Woops, I have completed jQuery a week ahead of schedule. (3 hours Non-Pro)
 
I plan to finish off the JavaScript final project and some jQuery projects in this week. 

But first I will get the HTML/CSS unit done. Plus the final project for HTML. This is because the jQuery final builds off the HTML project. 

Then onto AngularJS and Ruby...my head hurts already!

##Codecademy Pro | Free
With a Pro account you get a chose to pick a path. This will create a new tab next to All Courses called "My Path" as shown in the image below. Then you can get a visual representation of how you're doing and what is coming up next. You can argue that you could do that as a paper plan but its the convenience of having it. 

Personally it keeps me on track, where as usually I go from one course to another completing odd bits (Yes I completed jQuery while doing JS but I got engrossed...).

As said about in the Quizzes section I think we need to see more of them and some other techniques/learning games. This will help people with different mindsets on learning and also some disabilities. 


####Challenge Idea
Have a timer where you have to see how many questions/puzzles at random you can answer within the time frame. This could be updated on a "High Score" board with sections for different countries and programming languages. Plus having it so you can mix and match the content and difficulties settings that will be in the challenge. If this path goes well I might even have a go doing it myself!

So, at this stage I recommend Codecedemy Pro so far with what I have witnessed. I will keep reviewing it for my Week 2 update.

*If you have read though this id like to say thank you for taking the time to do so!*
