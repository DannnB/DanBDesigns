I am a Web Developer and Designer from Worcester, UK. I enjoy CSS styling and using frontend development tools (Headaches at times donâ€™t you think?). Working part-time, I develop and learn away from work as much as I can. If you like collections of inspirational materiel have a look at my [Pintrest](https://www.pinterest.com/DanBDesigns/) where I collect my favourite designs and subjects.

I have studied and experienced a range of stuff from print to screen. Collage and University. 

Also having a large curated collection of books I enjoy. Science/Physics, Design, Web, Fine Art, Encyclopaedias (*Sometimes better than Google for ideas*), Graphic Novels/Comics.  [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/DanBDesigns/){:target="_blank"} is my main online source for these topics.

[Michio Kaku](http://mkaku.org/){:target="_blank"} is one of my favourite physicists.


In my spare time I play guitar, game/mod, watch Ted, YouTube and like to be in the fresh air, biking, kayaking & paddle boarding (when I can).
