I am a Web Developer and Designer from Worcester, UK. I enjoy css styling and using frontend dev tools (Headaches at times donâ€™t you think?). Working full-time, I develope and learn away from work as much as I can. If you like collections of insperiational meterial have a look at my Pinterest where I collect my favoute designs and subjects.
