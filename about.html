    <p>I am a Web Developer and Designer from Worcester, UK. I enjoy CSS styling and using front-end development tools (Headaches at times donâ€™t you think?). Working part-time, I develop and learn away from work as much as I can. If you like collections of inspirational design have a look at my [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/DanBDesigns/) where I collect my favorite pieces.</p>
    <p>I keep a large collection of books I enjoy on many subjects. Such as, Science/Physics, Design, Web, Fine Art, Photography, Encyclopedias (Sometimes better than Google for ideas) and Graphic Novels/Comics. [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/DanBDesigns/) is my main online source for these topics.</p>
    <p>Michio Kaku(http://mkaku.org/) is one of my favorite physicists.</p>
    <p>Away from web and design I play guitar, game and content creation for games. When I get out I do a lot of Biking and kayaking & paddle boarding when I can.</p>
